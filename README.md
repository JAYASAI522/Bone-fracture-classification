# 🦴 Bone Fracture Classification Using Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on automating the classification of bone fractures in X-ray images using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. By leveraging advanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures like **ResNet50** and **DeepConvNet**, the system is capable of identifying fractures with high accuracy.

## 🧠 Model Architectures Used
- **ResNet50**: A deep residual network with 50 layers, used for its ability to prevent vanishing gradient problems and extract deep features from complex medical images.
- **DeepConvNet**: A custom-built deep CNN architecture tailored for X-ray image classification tasks, designed to capture localized fracture patterns.

## 🖼️ Image Enhancement Techniques
- **Canny Edge Detection** was applied during preprocessing to enhance the visibility of fracture lines in X-ray images. This technique improved the model's ability to distinguish subtle breaks and improve overall feature extraction.

## 📊 Dataset
The model was trained and validated using the publicly available **Kaggle X-ray Bone Fracture Dataset**, which contains labeled X-ray images of fractured and non-fractured bones. Data augmentation and preprocessing techniques were applied to improve generalization.

## 📈 Performance Evaluation
- Utilized evaluation metrics such as **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1 Score** to assess the model's effectiveness.
- Visualization techniques like **confusion matrices** and **ROC curves** were used to interpret results.

## 🔍 Key Highlights
- Efficient use of transfer learning with ResNet50 improved convergence and accuracy.
- Integration of traditional image processing (Canny) with deep learning.
- Clean, modular code with support for reproducible experimentation.

## 🧪 Future Work
- Extend to multiclass classification for different types of fractures (e.g., greenstick, spiral, transverse).
- Real-time integration with a diagnostic tool or mobile app.
- Fine-tuning with larger medical datasets for better generalizability.
